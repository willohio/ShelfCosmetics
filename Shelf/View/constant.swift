The Service is operated and owned by Shelf Cosmetics, LLC (“Shelf”). If you do not agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy, do not use this Service.\n\nOur Commitment to Privacy\n\nPrivacy of individual visitor data is of primary importance to Shelf. We will work diligently to protect confidentiality, restrict transfer of personal data, and incorporate technical safeguards and appropriate security policies to protect information you may share with us.\n\nShelf has created this privacy statement to explain what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we may use or share that information.\n\nThis Service may contain links to other sites. Third party sites accessed via links from the Service are not covered by this policy, nor is Shelf responsible in any way for such sites or the collection or protection of information on those sites.\n\nGathering Information\n\nShelf will collect information about you in a number of ways. Information gathered may include your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and / or date of birth. Additionally, when you pay for products through Shelf, information may be given to us such as your credit card number.\n\nWe will only collect personal information that is necessary for us to provide our services to you. Your personally identifiable information may be given to us directly, or it may be authorized to be given to us by someone else.\n\nWe also may passively gather basic web-browsing data in aggregate and anonymized form, including information about where visitors are located and what platforms visitors are using. This includes information like your IP address, ISP, internet browser, and certain system settings that are generally made available to any website you visit.\n\nThird Party Sharing\n\nWe do not share information with third party sources unless sharing is necessary for us to deliver our services. In this context, information sharing includes using personally identifiable information to store and maintain your items as well as providing personally identifiable information to third party payment companies.  Third party payment partners will be identified, and inquiries should be directed to these partners regarding the protection of such information. Currently, we are taking payments through stripe.com.\n\nInformation may also be shared as otherwise required by law. For example, provided information may be shared with law enforcement upon proper legal service to conduct an internal investigation, protect the integrity of the site or otherwise protect against unlawful activity.\n\nOur successors and assigns will similarly be bound by this policy. From time to time, Shelf may need to change its privacy statement because of changes in its business, or in its attempts to serve your needs better. Shelf will use reasonable efforts to publish any changes to its privacy policy, including publishing the current terms on our website.  Please check back from time to time to review any changes to our policy.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, please contact us at hello@SHELFcosmetics.com."
